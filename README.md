# Flashcord-Store_Refresher
Uses the Flashstore API to automatically refresh the Flashcord Store.


## This code is no longer relevent for the Flashcord Store as everything is rewritten in Javascript and everything this server-side script does is now done on the client side instead.
At least it will be when I actually release the god damn rewrite.
